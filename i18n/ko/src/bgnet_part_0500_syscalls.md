# System Calls or Bust

This is the section where we get into the system calls (and other
library calls) that allow you to access the network functionality of a
Unix box, or any box that supports the sockets API for that matter (BSD,
Windows, Linux, Mac, what-have-you.) When you call one of these
functions, the kernel takes over and does all the work for you
automagically.

The place most people get stuck around here is what order to call these
things in. In that, the `man` pages are no use, as you've probably
discovered. Well, to help with that dreadful situation, I've tried to
lay out the system calls in the following sections in _exactly_
(approximately) the same order that you'll need to call them in your
programs.

That, coupled with a few pieces of sample code here and there, some milk
and cookies (which I fear you will have to supply yourself), and some
raw guts and courage, and you'll be beaming data around the Internet
like the Son of Jon Postel!

_(Please note that for brevity, many code snippets below do not include
necessary error checking. And they very commonly assume that the result
from calls to `getaddrinfo()` succeed and return a valid entry in the
linked list. Both of these situations are properly addressed in the
stand-alone programs, though, so use those as a model.)_


## `getaddrinfo()`---Prepare to launch!

[i[`getaddrinfo()` function]] This is a real workhorse of a function
with a lot of options, but usage is actually pretty simple. It helps set
up the `struct`s you need later on.

A tiny bit of history: it used to be that you would use a function
called `gethostbyname()` to do DNS lookups. Then you'd load that
information by hand into a `struct sockaddr_in`, and use that in your
calls.

This is no longer necessary, thankfully. (Nor is it desirable, if you
want to write code that works for both IPv4 and IPv6!)  In these modern
times, you now have the function `getaddrinfo()` that does all kinds of
good stuff for you, including DNS and service name lookups, and fills
out the `struct`s you need, besides!

Let's take a look!

```{.c}
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netdb.h>

int getaddrinfo(const char *node,     // e.g. "www.example.com" or IP
                const char *service,  // e.g. "http" or port number
                const struct addrinfo *hints,
                struct addrinfo **res);
```

You give this function three input parameters, and it gives you a
pointer to a linked-list, `res`, of results.

The `node` parameter is the host name to connect to, or an IP address.

Next is the parameter `service`, which can be a port number, like "80",
or the name of a particular service (found in [fl[The IANA Port
List|https://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers]] or the
`/etc/services` file on your Unix machine) like "http" or "ftp" or
"telnet" or "smtp" or whatever.

Finally, the `hints` parameter points to a `struct addrinfo` that you've
already filled out with relevant information.

Here's a sample call if you're a server who wants to listen on your
host's IP address, port 3490. Note that this doesn't actually do any
listening or network setup; it merely sets up structures we'll use
later:

```{.c .numberLines}
int status;
struct addrinfo hints;
struct addrinfo *servinfo;  // will point to the results

memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints); // make sure the struct is empty
hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;     // don't care IPv4 or IPv6
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; // TCP stream sockets
hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE;     // fill in my IP for me

if ((status = getaddrinfo(NULL, "3490", &hints, &servinfo)) != 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "getaddrinfo error: %s\n", gai_strerror(status));
    exit(1);
}

// servinfo now points to a linked list of 1 or more struct addrinfos

// ... do everything until you don't need servinfo anymore ....

freeaddrinfo(servinfo); // free the linked-list
```

Notice that I set the `ai_family` to `AF_UNSPEC`, thereby saying that I
don't care if we use IPv4 or IPv6. You can set it to `AF_INET` or
`AF_INET6` if you want one or the other specifically.

Also, you'll see the `AI_PASSIVE` flag in there; this tells
`getaddrinfo()` to assign the address of my local host to the socket
structures. This is nice because then you don't have to hardcode it. (Or
you can put a specific address in as the first parameter to
`getaddrinfo()` where I currently have `NULL`, up there.)

Then we make the call. If there's an error (`getaddrinfo()` returns
non-zero), we can print it out using the function `gai_strerror()`, as
you see. If everything works properly, though, `servinfo` will point to
a linked list of `struct addrinfo`s, each of which contains a `struct
sockaddr` of some kind that we can use later! Nifty!

Finally, when we're eventually all done with the linked list that
`getaddrinfo()` so graciously allocated for us, we can (and should) free
it all up with a call to `freeaddrinfo()`.

Here's a sample call if you're a client who wants to connect to a
particular server, say "www.example.net" port 3490. Again, this doesn't
actually connect, but it sets up the structures we'll use later:

```{.c .numberLines}
int status;
struct addrinfo hints;
struct addrinfo *servinfo;  // will point to the results

memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints); // make sure the struct is empty
hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;     // don't care IPv4 or IPv6
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; // TCP stream sockets

// get ready to connect
status = getaddrinfo("www.example.net", "3490", &hints, &servinfo);

// servinfo now points to a linked list of 1 or more struct addrinfos

// etc.
```

I keep saying that `servinfo` is a linked list with all kinds of address
information. Let's write a quick demo program to show off this
information. [flx[This short program|showip.c]] will print the IP
addresses for whatever host you specify on the command line:

```{.c .numberLines}
/*
** showip.c -- show IP addresses for a host given on the command line
*/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netdb.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    struct addrinfo hints, *res, *p;
    int status;
    char ipstr[INET6_ADDRSTRLEN];

    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr,"usage: showip hostname\n");
        return 1;
    }

    memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints);
    hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC; // AF_INET or AF_INET6 to force version
    hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;

    if ((status = getaddrinfo(argv[1], NULL, &hints, &res)) != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "getaddrinfo: %s\n", gai_strerror(status));
        return 2;
    }

    printf("IP addresses for %s:\n\n", argv[1]);

    for(p = res;p != NULL; p = p->ai_next) {
        void *addr;
        char *ipver;

        // get the pointer to the address itself,
        // different fields in IPv4 and IPv6:
        if (p->ai_family == AF_INET) { // IPv4
            struct sockaddr_in *ipv4 = (struct sockaddr_in *)p->ai_addr;
            addr = &(ipv4->sin_addr);
            ipver = "IPv4";
        } else { // IPv6
            struct sockaddr_in6 *ipv6 = (struct sockaddr_in6 *)p->ai_addr;
            addr = &(ipv6->sin6_addr);
            ipver = "IPv6";
        }

        // convert the IP to a string and print it:
        inet_ntop(p->ai_family, addr, ipstr, sizeof ipstr);
        printf("  %s: %s\n", ipver, ipstr);
    }

    freeaddrinfo(res); // free the linked list

    return 0;
}
```

As you see, the code calls `getaddrinfo()` on whatever you pass on the
command line, that fills out the linked list pointed to by `res`, and
then we can iterate over the list and print stuff out or do whatever.

(There's a little bit of ugliness there where we have to dig into the
different types of `struct sockaddr`s depending on the IP version. Sorry
about that! I'm not sure of a better way around it.)

Sample run! Everyone loves screenshots:

```
$ showip www.example.net
IP addresses for www.example.net:

  IPv4: 192.0.2.88

$ showip ipv6.example.com
IP addresses for ipv6.example.com:

  IPv4: 192.0.2.101
  IPv6: 2001:db8:8c00:22::171
```

Now that we have that under control, we'll use the results we get from
`getaddrinfo()` to pass to other socket functions and, at long last, get
our network connection established! Keep reading!


## `socket()`---Get the File Descriptor! {#socket}

I guess I can put it off no longer---I have to talk about the
[i[`socket()` function]] `socket()` system call. Here's the breakdown:

```{.c}
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol); 
```

But what are these arguments? They allow you to say what kind of socket
you want (IPv4 or IPv6, stream or datagram, and TCP or UDP).

It used to be people would hardcode these values, and you can absolutely
still do that. (`domain` is `PF_INET` or `PF_INET6`, `type` is
`SOCK_STREAM` or `SOCK_DGRAM`, and `protocol` can be set to `0` to
choose the proper protocol for the given `type`. Or you can call
`getprotobyname()` to look up the protocol you want, "tcp" or "udp".)

(This `PF_INET` thing is a close relative of the [i[`AF_INET` macro]]
`AF_INET` that you can use when initializing the `sin_family` field in
your `struct sockaddr_in`. In fact, they're so closely related that they
actually have the same value, and many programmers will call `socket()`
and pass `AF_INET` as the first argument instead of `PF_INET`. Now, get
some milk and cookies, because it's time for a story. Once upon a time,
a long time ago, it was thought that maybe an address family (what the
"AF" in "`AF_INET`" stands for) might support several protocols that
were referred to by their protocol family (what the "PF" in "`PF_INET`"
stands for). That didn't happen. And they all lived happily ever after,
The End. So the most correct thing to do is to use `AF_INET` in your
`struct sockaddr_in` and `PF_INET` in your call to `socket()`.)

Anyway, enough of that. What you really want to do is use the values
from the results of the call to `getaddrinfo()`, and feed them into
`socket()` directly like this:

```{.c .numberLines}
int s;
struct addrinfo hints, *res;

// do the lookup
// [pretend we already filled out the "hints" struct]
getaddrinfo("www.example.com", "http", &hints, &res);

// again, you should do error-checking on getaddrinfo(), and walk
// the "res" linked list looking for valid entries instead of just
// assuming the first one is good (like many of these examples do).
// See the section on client/server for real examples.

s = socket(res->ai_family, res->ai_socktype, res->ai_protocol);
```

`socket()` simply returns to you a _socket descriptor_ that you can use
in later system calls, or `-1` on error. The global variable `errno` is
set to the error's value (see the [`errno`](#errnoman) man page for more
details, and a quick note on using `errno` in multithreaded programs).

Fine, fine, fine, but what good is this socket? The answer is that it's
really no good by itself, and you need to read on and make more system
calls for it to make any sense.


## `bind()`---What port am I on? {#bind}

[i[`bind()` function]] Once you have a socket, you might have to
associate that socket with a [i[Port]] port on your local machine. (This
is commonly done if you're going to [i[`listen()` function]] `listen()`
for incoming connections on a specific port---multiplayer network games
do this when they tell you to "connect to 192.168.5.10 port 3490".) The
port number is used by the kernel to match an incoming packet to a
certain process's socket descriptor. If you're going to only be doing a
[i[`connect()`] function] `connect()` (because you're the client, not
the server), this is probably unnecessary. Read it anyway, just for
kicks.

Here is the synopsis for the `bind()` system call:

```{.c}
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int bind(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *my_addr, int addrlen);
```

`sockfd` is the socket file descriptor returned by `socket()`. `my_addr`
is a pointer to a `struct sockaddr` that contains information about your
address, namely, port and [i[IP address]] IP address. `addrlen` is the
length in bytes of that address.

Whew. That's a bit to absorb in one chunk. Let's have an example that
binds the socket to the host the program is running on, port 3490:

```{.c .numberLines}
struct addrinfo hints, *res;
int sockfd;

// first, load up address structs with getaddrinfo():

memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints);
hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;  // use IPv4 or IPv6, whichever
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE;     // fill in my IP for me

getaddrinfo(NULL, "3490", &hints, &res);

// make a socket:

sockfd = socket(res->ai_family, res->ai_socktype, res->ai_protocol);

// bind it to the port we passed in to getaddrinfo():

bind(sockfd, res->ai_addr, res->ai_addrlen);
```

By using the `AI_PASSIVE` flag, I'm telling the program to bind to the
IP of the host it's running on. If you want to bind to a specific local
IP address, drop the `AI_PASSIVE` and put an IP address in for the first
argument to `getaddrinfo()`.

`bind()` also returns `-1` on error and sets `errno` to the error's
value.

Lots of old code manually packs the `struct sockaddr_in` before calling
`bind()`. Obviously this is IPv4-specific, but there's really nothing
stopping you from doing the same thing with IPv6, except that using
`getaddrinfo()` is going to be easier, generally. Anyway, the old code
looks something like this:

```{.c .numberLines}
// !!! THIS IS THE OLD WAY !!!

int sockfd;
struct sockaddr_in my_addr;

sockfd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

my_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
my_addr.sin_port = htons(MYPORT);     // short, network byte order
my_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("10.12.110.57");
memset(my_addr.sin_zero, '\0', sizeof my_addr.sin_zero);

bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&my_addr, sizeof my_addr);
```

In the above code, you could also assign `INADDR_ANY` to the `s_addr`
field if you wanted to bind to your local IP address (like the
`AI_PASSIVE` flag, above).  The IPv6 version of `INADDR_ANY` is a global
variable `in6addr_any` that is assigned into the `sin6_addr` field of
your `struct sockaddr_in6`. (There is also a macro `IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT`
that you can use in a variable initializer.)

Another thing to watch out for when calling `bind()`: don't go
underboard with your port numbers. [i[Port]] All ports below 1024 are
RESERVED (unless you're the superuser)! You can have any port number
above that, right up to 65535 (provided they aren't already being used
by another program).

Sometimes, you might notice, you try to rerun a server and `bind()`
fails, claiming [i[Address already in use]] "Address already in use."
What does that mean? Well, a little bit of a socket that was connected
is still hanging around in the kernel, and it's hogging the port. You
can either wait for it to clear (a minute or so), or add code to your
program allowing it to reuse the port, like this:

[i[`setsockopt()` function]]
 [i[`SO_REUSEADDR` macro]]

```{.c .numberLines}
int yes=1;
//char yes='1'; // Solaris people use this

// lose the pesky "Address already in use" error message
if (setsockopt(listener,SOL_SOCKET,SO_REUSEADDR,&yes,sizeof yes) == -1) {
    perror("setsockopt");
    exit(1);
} 
```

[i[`bind()` function]] One small extra final note about `bind()`: there
are times when you won't absolutely have to call it. If you are
[i[`connect()` function]] `connect()`ing to a remote machine and you
don't care what your local port is (as is the case with `telnet` where
you only care about the remote port), you can simply call `connect()`,
it'll check to see if the socket is unbound, and will `bind()` it to an
unused local port if necessary.


## `connect()`---Hey, you! {#connect}

[i[`connect()` function]] Let's just pretend for a few minutes that
you're a telnet application. Your user commands you (just like in the
movie [i[TRON]] _TRON_) to get a socket file descriptor. You comply and
call `socket()`. Next, the user tells you to connect to "`10.12.110.57`"
on port "`23`" (the standard telnet port). Yow! What do you do now?

Lucky for you, program, you're now perusing the section on
`connect()`---how to connect to a remote host. So read furiously onward!
No time to lose!

The `connect()` call is as follows:

```{.c}
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int connect(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *serv_addr, int addrlen); 
```

`sockfd` is our friendly neighborhood socket file descriptor, as
returned by the `socket()` call, `serv_addr` is a `struct sockaddr`
containing the destination port and IP address, and `addrlen` is the
length in bytes of the server address structure.

All of this information can be gleaned from the results of the
`getaddrinfo()` call, which rocks.

Is this starting to make more sense? I can't hear you from here, so I'll
just have to hope that it is. Let's have an example where we make a
socket connection to "`www.example.com`", port `3490`:

```{.c .numberLines}
struct addrinfo hints, *res;
int sockfd;

// first, load up address structs with getaddrinfo():

memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints);
hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;

getaddrinfo("www.example.com", "3490", &hints, &res);

// make a socket:

sockfd = socket(res->ai_family, res->ai_socktype, res->ai_protocol);

// connect!

connect(sockfd, res->ai_addr, res->ai_addrlen);
```

Again, old-school programs filled out their own `struct sockaddr_in`s to
pass to `connect()`. You can do that if you want to. See the similar
note in the [`bind()` section](#bind), above.

Be sure to check the return value from `connect()`---it'll return `-1`
on error and set the variable `errno`.

[i[`bind()` function-->implicit]]

Also, notice that we didn't call `bind()`. Basically, we don't care
about our local port number; we only care where we're going (the remote
port). The kernel will choose a local port for us, and the site we
connect to will automatically get this information from us. No worries.


## `listen()`---Will somebody please call me? {#listen}

[i[`listen()` function]] OK, time for a change of pace. What if you
don't want to connect to a remote host. Say, just for kicks, that you
want to wait for incoming connections and handle them in some way. The
process is two step: first you `listen()`, then you [i[`accept()`
function]] `accept()` (see below).

The `listen()` call is fairly simple, but requires a bit of explanation:

```{.c}
int listen(int sockfd, int backlog); 
```

`sockfd` is the usual socket file descriptor from the `socket()` system
call.  [i[`listen()` function-->backlog]] `backlog` is the number of
connections allowed on the incoming queue. What does that mean? Well,
incoming connections are going to wait in this queue until you
`accept()` them (see below) and this is the limit on how many can queue
up. Most systems silently limit this number to about 20; you can
probably get away with setting it to `5` or `10`.

Again, as per usual, `listen()` returns `-1` and sets `errno` on error.

Well, as you can probably imagine, we need to call `bind()` before we
call `listen()` so that the server is running on a specific port. (You
have to be able to tell your buddies which port to connect to!)  So if
you're going to be listening for incoming connections, the sequence of
system calls you'll make is:

```{.c .numberLines}
getaddrinfo();
socket();
bind();
listen();
/* accept() goes here */ 
```

I'll just leave that in the place of sample code, since it's fairly
self-explanatory. (The code in the `accept()` section, below, is more
complete.) The really tricky part of this whole sha-bang is the call to
`accept()`.


## `accept()`---"Thank you for calling port 3490."

[i[`accept()` function]] Get ready---the `accept()` call is kinda weird!
What's going to happen is this: someone far far away will try to
`connect()` to your machine on a port that you are `listen()`ing on.
Their connection will be queued up waiting to be `accept()`ed. You call
`accept()` and you tell it to get the pending connection. It'll return
to you a _brand new socket file descriptor_ to use for this single
connection! That's right, suddenly you have _two socket file
descriptors_ for the price of one! The original one is still listening
for more new connections, and the newly created one is finally ready to
`send()` and `recv()`. We're there! 

The call is as follows:

```{.c}
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen); 
```

`sockfd` is the `listen()`ing socket descriptor. Easy enough. `addr`
will usually be a pointer to a local `struct sockaddr_storage`. This is
where the information about the incoming connection will go (and with it
you can determine which host is calling you from which port). `addrlen`
is a local integer variable that should be set to `sizeof(struct
sockaddr_storage)` before its address is passed to `accept()`.
`accept()` will not put more than that many bytes into `addr`. If it
puts fewer in, it'll change the value of `addrlen` to reflect that.

Guess what? `accept()` returns `-1` and sets `errno` if an error occurs.
Betcha didn't figure that.

Like before, this is a bunch to absorb in one chunk, so here's a sample
code fragment for your perusal:

```{.c .numberLines}
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netdb.h>

#define MYPORT "3490"  // the port users will be connecting to
#define BACKLOG 10     // how many pending connections queue will hold

int main(void)
{
    struct sockaddr_storage their_addr;
    socklen_t addr_size;
    struct addrinfo hints, *res;
    int sockfd, new_fd;

    // !! don't forget your error checking for these calls !!

    // first, load up address structs with getaddrinfo():

    memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints);
    hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;  // use IPv4 or IPv6, whichever
    hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
    hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE;     // fill in my IP for me

    getaddrinfo(NULL, MYPORT, &hints, &res);

    // make a socket, bind it, and listen on it:

    sockfd = socket(res->ai_family, res->ai_socktype, res->ai_protocol);
    bind(sockfd, res->ai_addr, res->ai_addrlen);
    listen(sockfd, BACKLOG);

    // now accept an incoming connection:

    addr_size = sizeof their_addr;
    new_fd = accept(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&their_addr, &addr_size);

    // ready to communicate on socket descriptor new_fd!
    .
    .
    .
```

Again, note that we will use the socket descriptor `new_fd` for all
`send()` and `recv()` calls. If you're only getting one single
connection ever, you can `close()` the listening `sockfd` in order to
prevent more incoming connections on the same port, if you so desire.


## `send()` and `recv()`---Talk to me, baby! {#sendrecv}

These two functions are for communicating over stream sockets or
connected datagram sockets. If you want to use regular unconnected
datagram sockets, you'll need to see the section on [`sendto()` and
`recvfrom()`](#sendtorecv), below.

[i[`send()` function]] The `send()` call:

```{.c}
int send(int sockfd, const void *msg, int len, int flags); 
```

`sockfd` is the socket descriptor you want to send data to (whether it's
the one returned by `socket()` or the one you got with `accept()`).
`msg` is a pointer to the data you want to send, and `len` is the length
of that data in bytes.  Just set `flags` to `0`. (See the `send()` man
page for more information concerning flags.)

Some sample code might be:

```{.c .numberLines}
char *msg = "Beej was here!";
int len, bytes_sent;
.
.
.
len = strlen(msg);
bytes_sent = send(sockfd, msg, len, 0);
.
.
. 
```

`send()` returns the number of bytes actually sent out---_this might be
less than the number you told it to send!_  See, sometimes you tell it
to send a whole gob of data and it just can't handle it. It'll fire off
as much of the data as it can, and trust you to send the rest later.
Remember, if the value returned by `send()` doesn't match the value in
`len`, it's up to you to send the rest of the string. The good news is
this: if the packet is small (less than 1K or so) it will _probably_
manage to send the whole thing all in one go.  Again, `-1` is returned
on error, and `errno` is set to the error number.

[i[`recv()` function]] The `recv()` call is similar in many respects:

```{.c}
int recv(int sockfd, void *buf, int len, int flags);
```

`sockfd` is the socket descriptor to read from, `buf` is the buffer to
read the information into, `len` is the maximum length of the buffer,
and `flags` can again be set to `0`. (See the `recv()` man page for flag
information.)

`recv()` returns the number of bytes actually read into the buffer, or
`-1` on error (with `errno` set, accordingly).

Wait! `recv()` can return `0`. This can mean only one thing: the remote
side has closed the connection on you! A return value of `0` is
`recv()`'s way of letting you know this has occurred.

There, that was easy, wasn't it? You can now pass data back and forth on
stream sockets! Whee! You're a Unix Network Programmer!


## `sendto()` and `recvfrom()`---Talk to me, DGRAM-style {#sendtorecv}

[i[`SOCK_DGRAM` macro]] "This is all fine and dandy," I hear you saying,
"but where does this leave me with unconnected datagram sockets?" No
problemo, amigo. We have just the thing.

Since datagram sockets aren't connected to a remote host, guess which
piece of information we need to give before we send a packet? That's
right! The destination address! Here's the scoop:

```{.c}
int sendto(int sockfd, const void *msg, int len, unsigned int flags,
           const struct sockaddr *to, socklen_t tolen); 
```

As you can see, this call is basically the same as the call to `send()`
with the addition of two other pieces of information. `to` is a pointer
to a `struct sockaddr` (which will probably be another `struct
sockaddr_in` or `struct sockaddr_in6` or `struct sockaddr_storage` that
you cast at the last minute) which contains the destination [i[IP
address]] IP address and [i[Port]] port. `tolen`, an `int` deep-down,
can simply be set to `sizeof *to` or `sizeof(struct sockaddr_storage)`.

To get your hands on the destination address structure, you'll probably
either get it from `getaddrinfo()`, or from `recvfrom()`, below, or
you'll fill it out by hand.

Just like with `send()`, `sendto()` returns the number of bytes actually
sent (which, again, might be less than the number of bytes you told it
to send!), or `-1` on error.

Equally similar are `recv()` and [i[`recvfrom()` function]]
`recvfrom()`. The synopsis of `recvfrom()` is:

```{.c}
int recvfrom(int sockfd, void *buf, int len, unsigned int flags,
             struct sockaddr *from, int *fromlen); 
```

Again, this is just like `recv()` with the addition of a couple fields.
`from` is a pointer to a local [i[`struct sockaddr` type]] `struct
sockaddr_storage` that will be filled with the IP address and port of
the originating machine. `fromlen` is a pointer to a local `int` that
should be initialized to `sizeof *from` or `sizeof(struct
sockaddr_storage)`. When the function returns, `fromlen` will contain
the length of the address actually stored in `from`.

`recvfrom()` returns the number of bytes received, or `-1` on error
(with `errno` set accordingly).

So, here's a question: why do we use `struct sockaddr_storage` as the
socket type? Why not `struct sockaddr_in`? Because, you see, we want to
not tie ourselves down to IPv4 or IPv6. So we use the generic `struct
sockaddr_storage` which we know will be big enough for either.

(So... here's another question: why isn't `struct sockaddr` itself big
enough for any address? We even cast the general-purpose `struct
sockaddr_storage` to the general-purpose `struct sockaddr`! Seems
extraneous and redundant, huh. The answer is, it just isn't big enough,
and I'd guess that changing it at this point would be Problematic. So
they made a new one.)

Remember, if you [i[`connect()` function-->on datagram sockets]]
`connect()` a datagram socket, you can then simply use `send()` and
`recv()` for all your transactions. The socket itself is still a
datagram socket and the packets still use UDP, but the socket interface
will automatically add the destination and source information for you.


## `close()` and `shutdown()`---Get outta my face!

Whew! You've been `send()`ing and `recv()`ing data all day long, and
you've had it. You're ready to close the connection on your socket
descriptor. This is easy. You can just use the regular Unix file
descriptor [i[`close()` function]] `close()` function:

```{.c}
close(sockfd); 
```

This will prevent any more reads and writes to the socket. Anyone
attempting to read or write the socket on the remote end will receive an
error.

Just in case you want a little more control over how the socket closes,
you can use the [i[`shutdown()` function]] `shutdown()` function. It
allows you to cut off communication in a certain direction, or both ways
(just like `close()` does). Synopsis:

```{.c}
int shutdown(int sockfd, int how); 
```

`sockfd` is the socket file descriptor you want to shutdown, and `how`
is one of the following:

| `how` | Effect                                                     |
|:-----:|------------------------------------------------------------|
|  `0`  | Further receives are disallowed                            |
|  `1`  | Further sends are disallowed                               |
|  `2`  | Further sends and receives are disallowed (like `close()`) |

`shutdown()` returns `0` on success, and `-1` on error (with `errno` set
accordingly).

If you deign to use `shutdown()` on unconnected datagram sockets, it
will simply make the socket unavailable for further `send()` and
`recv()` calls (remember that you can use these if you `connect()` your
datagram socket).

It's important to note that `shutdown()` doesn't actually close the file
descriptor---it just changes its usability. To free a socket descriptor,
you need to use `close()`.

Nothing to it.

(Except to remember that if you're using [i[Windows]] Windows and
[i[Winsock]] Winsock that you should call [i[`closesocket()` function]]
`closesocket()` instead of `close()`.)


## `getpeername()`---Who are you?

[i[`getpeername()` function]] This function is so easy.

It's so easy, I almost didn't give it its own section. But here it is
anyway.

The function `getpeername()` will tell you who is at the other end of a
connected stream socket. The synopsis:

```{.c}
#include <sys/socket.h>

int getpeername(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, int *addrlen); 
```

`sockfd` is the descriptor of the connected stream socket, `addr` is a
pointer to a `struct sockaddr` (or a `struct sockaddr_in`) that will
hold the information about the other side of the connection, and
`addrlen` is a pointer to an `int`, that should be initialized to
`sizeof *addr` or `sizeof(struct sockaddr)`.

The function returns `-1` on error and sets `errno` accordingly.

Once you have their address, you can use [i[`inet_ntop()` function]]
`inet_ntop()`, [i[`getnameinfo()` function]] `getnameinfo()`, or
[i[`gethostbyaddr()` function]] `gethostbyaddr()` to print or get more
information. No, you can't get their login name. (Ok, ok. If the other
computer is running an ident daemon, this is possible. This, however, is
beyond the scope of this document. Check out [flrfc[RFC 1413|1413]] for
more info.)


## `gethostname()`---Who am I?

[i[`gethostname()` function]] Even easier than `getpeername()` is the
function `gethostname()`. It returns the name of the computer that your
program is running on. The name can then be used by [i[`getaddrinfo()`
function]] `getaddrinfo()`, above, to determine the [i[IP address]] IP
address of your local machine.

What could be more fun? I could think of a few things, but they don't
pertain to socket programming. Anyway, here's the breakdown:

```{.c}
#include <unistd.h>

int gethostname(char *hostname, size_t size); 
```

The arguments are simple: `hostname` is a pointer to an array of chars that will
contain the hostname upon the function's return, and `size` is the length in
bytes of the `hostname` array.

The function returns `0` on successful completion, and `-1` on error, setting
`errno` as usual.
